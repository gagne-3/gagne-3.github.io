				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, I thought that 9th grade would be just like 8th grade, but it turned out I was wrong. I feel that I am more matured, and organized from this year, and I think this will help me later on in my life. One DRSS quality that I had to rely on most was creativity. This year involved a lot of projects that involved making some sort of media or writing a script. Projects like the Chinese rap involved my group members and I to have a lot of creativity, not only to meet the criteria, but also to have a good product. I also had to use creativity in the colored pencil project, as we had lots of different shape transformations to have, but also have a creative pattern. I feel that this year has completely prepared me for 10th grade because of what I have learned, and the different techniques I used this year. Geometry taught me a lot of what I have yet to learn, and I feel that there was a lot I learned that I could apply later in life. The time tests also helped me mastered different math procedures. I also learned Chinese, which is very useful, since a lot of the population speaks Chinese. One technique I used to keep organized this year was to keep an agenda, as it helps me keep track of all my classes. I also got an agenda for outside of school because of how useful it was to have one. In 10th grade, I want to not only learn more, but I also want to do work much harder. I think that if I work harder, I will get not only better grades, but also learn more, and understand better. Overall, I learned a lot in 9th grade that will affect me later on in my life, and also in the 10th grade. </br></br>
