			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August of this year, I thought that 9th grade was going to be very difficult. Everyone had told me that it gets a lot more difficult in the 9th grade, but that was not my experience. While it is a bit more difficult than 8th grade, I feel that I adapted to the conditions of 9th grade. At the beginning, it was pretty easy, but I knew that it would get harder, and it did, but y changing the way I did work, I was able to adapt to the situation. One of the things I did to adapt to 9th grade was keeping an agenda. In 8th grade, the homework was minimal, and I was able to remember it, but in 9th grade, we had homework almost every night. I used an old notebook that I had to keep track of my homework and check off the things I completed. This has definitely made me more efficient in my homework since August. I also learned that I could apply this to things other than my schoolwork. I decided to use another notebook to write down things I need to do. I think this behavior has definitely helped for high school, and for later on in my life. I believe that me keeping an agenda and other changes I have made this year have prepared me for the rigors of 10th grade. </br></br>
