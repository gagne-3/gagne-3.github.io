				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One project I struggled in this year was the apocalyptic short story project in language arts. For this project, we had to write a short story about a post-apocalyptic group of people trying to survive. I initially struggled with this project because I am not that good at writing realistic stories. I am very good at coming up with alternate universes for stories, but when it comes to it being realistic, I start to have trouble. To overcome this struggle, I wrote as realistic a scenario I could before adding in some extra details. I am also not very good at adding details to the story, as I focus on the big picture before the details in a story. I worked on that by adding details as I wrote, which helped me incorporate them better in my story. I did a writing STEMersion last year, and if you look at my final story, you can see a big improvement. For my STEMersion story, there is not a lot of detail, but when you look at my short story, there is much more detail. Another project I struggled in was the Chinese rap project. For this project, we had to make a wrap in Chinese. This was difficult for my group, since this was all our first year of Chinese, and we only knew a few words and phrases. We initially had the idea of doing a military chant, but we could not come up with a good script. We eventually settled on a drumbeat, but it did not flow well with our script. We then found a good rap beat, which seemed to flow perfectly with our rap. We also used a sheet that our Chinese teacher gave us that had some names for sports, which was the focus of our rap. I also learned a lot about using Adobe Premiere Pro during this project, as I was the editor for the project. This year, I learned a lot about my struggles in these projects, and they will definitely help me in the future. </br>
