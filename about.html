      <h1>Robotics</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">One of my favorite extracurricular activities is FIRST Tech Challenge. I am part of the DRSS Varsity Robotics Team. FIRST is also a PBL Based organization that encourages innovative design. I have been doing Robotics for 5 years, and I am currently the team captain along with being lead programmer. I have also done some engineering work this year. In the past, I worked on Computer Aided-Design, and I even taught myself how to program. Here are some pictures of my robot from last year. Our robot is made from mostly 3D printed and laser cut parts. The only major component that is not 3D printed or laser cut is our custom chassis made of aluminum extrusion. Last season, our objective was to launch rings into a basket, and we did that with a launcher that I designed using our CAD software, Autodesk Inventor. Overall, robotics is one of my favorite extracurricular activities, and has taught me many valuable skills. If your interested, our website is <a href = "https://drssenterprise.wixsite.com/drssenterprise">here</a>, and our code is hosted <a href = "https://github.com/gagne-3/DRSS_21_22_Season_Auto_Update">here</a>. </h5>

      <h1>Heroux Devtek Internship</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Last summer, I did an internship at the company my dad works at, Heroux Devtek. Heroux Devtek is a Canadian landing gear manufacturing company that manufactures land gear for many commercial and military aircraft, such as the Boeing 777. During my internship, I helped the maintenance team get all of their spare parts inventoried into a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) called Interal. I also learned to inspect machined parts using different tools, such as micrometers, calipers, blade micrometers, depth micrometers, gauge blocks, gauge pins, and dial bore gauges. The final thing I learned during my internship was how to use their CAD software, Dassault CATIA. I learned how to read technical drawings for landing gear components and translate that into CATIA.</h5>

      <h1>National Honor Society</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Another extracurricular I am doing right now is National Honor Society. I joined NHS this year, but I was in National Junior Honor Society twice before (once in 7th grade, and again in 8th grade when I switched to the Dayton Regional STEM School). So far, I have been tutoring students on their portfolio coding, and I am planning on doing some more volunteer work.</h5>

      <h1>CAMP Dosser Maker Space Assistant</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In my 12th Grade year, I started being a maker space assistant at the Dayton Regional STEM Schoolâ€™s CAMP Dosser. CAMP Dosser is a maker space featuring all sorts of high-tech manufacturing equipment, such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and vinyl printers. As a maker space assistant, I take the job requests from the staff and get them running on the required machine. The project you see in the image below was a prototype for an architecture project. I hope this experience will help me in my future career as I will have gained knowledge on working with high-tech manufacturing equipment.</h5>
